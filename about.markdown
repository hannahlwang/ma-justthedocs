# About

MetaArchive uses the free open source LOCKSS archiving software to operate a network of preservation servers. Due to the low cost participation it is affordable for libraries of all sizes. LOCKSS is an ACM award winning digital preservation technology which preserves all formats and genres of web-published content from full fledged web sites to simple web hosted directories.

Content is stored in and restored to its original format. Participating institutions identify valuable digital assets that they wish to preserve safely. They make the corresponding digital content accessible to MetaArchive network servers, so-called LOCKSS caches, which are configured to copy content, update it to its latest versions on a regular basis, and ensure its integrity over time.

All content is stored in multiple copies on multiple caches at geographically dispersed locations. The MetaArchive network manages the number of replication so that a loss of all copies becomes extremely unlikely. If an institution loses preserved content for whatever reason its content is restored in its original form.
